### 5.1.3 Cheat Sheet Series

The [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][cheatsheets] provide a concise collection of high value information
on a wide range of specific application security topics.
The cheat sheets have been created by various application security professionals who have expertise in specific topics.

The Cheat Sheet Series [documentation project][cheatproject] is an OWASP Flagship Project in constant development.

#### What are the Cheat Sheets?

The Cheat Sheets are a series of self contained articles written by the security community
on a specific subject within the security domain.
The topics covered by the cheat sheets is wide, ranging from AJAX Security to XS (Cross Site) vulnerabilities.
Each cheat sheet provides an introduction to the subject which provides enough information to understand the basic concept.
It then goes on to describe its subject in more detail, often supplying recommendations or best practices.

The OWASP Cheat Sheets are a common body of knowledge created by the software security community
for a wide audience that is not confined to the security community.

#### Why use them?

The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series provide developers and security engineers with most, and perhaps all,
of the information on security topics that they will need to do their job.
In addition the Cheat Sheets are regarded as authoritative: it is recommended to follow the advice in these Cheat Sheets.
If a web application does not follow the recommendations in a cheat sheet, for example,
then the implementation could be challenged during the testing or review processes.

#### How to use them

The OWASP Spotlight series provides a good overview of using this documentation:
'Project 4 - [Cheat Sheet Series][spotlight04]'.

There are a lot of cheat sheets in the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series;
91 of them as of March 2024 and this number is set to increase.
The OWASP community recognises that this may become overwhelming at first, and so has arranged them in various ways:

* [Alphabetically][cheatsheet-alpha]
* Indexed to follow the [ASVS project][cheatsheet-asvs] or the [MASVS project][cheatsheet-masvs]
* Arranged in sections of the [OWASP Top 10][cheatsheet-top10] or the [OWASP Proactive Controls][cheatsheet-proactive]

The cheat sheets are continually being updated and are always open to contributions from the security community.
