### 5.1.2 Go Secure Coding Practices

The OWASP Go Secure Coding Practices (Go-SCP) is a set of software secure coding practices for Go.

The Go-SCP [documentation project][go-scp-project] is an OWASP Incubator Project
that has enough long term support to achieve Lab status soon.
The document can be [downloaded in various formats][go-scp-download] from the github repo.

#### What is Go-SCP?

Go-SCP provides examples and recommendations to help developers avoid common mistakes and pitfalls,
including code examples in Go that provide practical guidance on implementing the recommendations.
Go-SCP covers the OWASP [Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide][scp-qrf] topic-by-topic:

* Input Validation
* Sanitization Output Encoding
* Authentication and Password Management
* Session Management
* Access Control
* Cryptographic Practices
* Error Handling and Logging
* Data Protection
* Communication Security
* System Configuration
* Database Security
* File Management
* Memory Management
* General Coding Practices

The [Go Secure Coding Practices][go-scp-project] book is available in various formats:

* PDF
* ePub
* DocX
* MOBI

#### Why use Go-SCP?

Development teams often need help and support in getting the security right for web applications,
and part of this help comes from secure coding guidelines and best practices.
Go-SCP provides this guidance for a wide range of secure coding topics as well as providing practical code examples.

#### How to use Go-SCP?

The primary audience of the Go Secure Coding Practices Guide is developers,
particularly the ones with previous experience with other programming languages.

Download the [Go-SCP document][go-scp-download] in one of the formats: PDF, ePub, DocX and MOBI.
Refer to the specific topic chapter and then use the example Go code snippets for practical guidance on secure coding in Go.
