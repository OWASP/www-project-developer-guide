## 6.5 Verification Do's and Don'ts

[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm].

Verification takes skill and knowledge, so it is important to build on the existing experience
contained in these Do's and Dont's.

Sections:

6.5.1 [Secure environment](01-secure-environment.md)  
6.5.2 [System hardening](02-system-hardening.md)  
6.5.3 [Open Source software](03-open-source-software.md)
