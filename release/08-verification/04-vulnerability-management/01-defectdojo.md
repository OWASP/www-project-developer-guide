### 6.4.1 DefectDojo

OWASP [DefectDojo][defectdojo] is a DevSecOps tool for vulnerability management.
It provides one platform to orchestrate end-to-end security testing, vulnerability tracking,
deduplication, remediation, and reporting.

DefectDojo is an OWASP [Flagship project][defectdojo-project] and is well established;
the project was started in 2013 and has been in continuous development / release since then.

#### What is DefectDojo?

[DefectDojo][defectdojo] is an open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process
by integration of templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.

DefectDojo streamlines the testing process through several ‘models’ that an admin can manipulate with Python code.
The core models include:

* engagements
* tests
* findings

DefectDojo has supplemental models that facilitate :

* metrics
* authentication
* report generation
* tools

#### Why use it?

DefectDojo integrates with many open-source and proprietary/commercial [tools][defectdojo-tools] from various domains:

* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
* Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)
* Scanning of infrastructure and APIs

It also integrates with the [Threagile Threat Modeling][threagile] tool,
and with time more integrations with threat modeling tools will become available.

#### How to use it

Testing or installing DefectDojo is straight forward using the [installation instructions][defectdojo-install].
An instance of DefectDojo can be setup using [docker compose][defectdojo-docker] along with the associated scripts
that handle the dependencies, configure the database, create users and so on.
Refer to the DefectDojo [documentation][defectdojo-docs] for all the information on alternative deployments,
setting up, usage and integrations.
