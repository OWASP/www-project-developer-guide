### 4.2.1 Checklist: Define Security Requirements

A security requirement is a statement of security functionality that ensures software security is being satisfied.
Security requirements are derived from industry standards, applicable laws, and a history of past vulnerabilities.

Refer to proactive control [C1: Define Security Requirements][control1]
for more context from the OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls project,
and use the lists below as suggestions for a checklist that has been tailored for the individual project.

#### System configuration

* Restrict applications, processes and service accounts to the least privileges possible
* If the application must run with elevated privileges, raise privileges as late as possible, and drop as soon as possible
* Remove all unnecessary functionality and files
* Remove test code or any functionality not intended for production, prior to deployment
* The security configuration store for the application should be available in human readable form to support auditing
* Isolate development environments from production and provide access only to authorized development and test groups
* Implement a software change control system to manage and record changes to the code both in development and production

#### Cryptographic practices

* Use peer reviewed and open solution cryptographic modules
* All cryptographic functions used to protect secrets from the application user must be implemented on a trusted system
* Cryptographic modules must fail securely
* Ensure all random elements such as numbers, file names, UUID and strings are generated
    using the cryptographic module approved random number generator
* Cryptographic modules used by the application are compliant to FIPS 140-2 or an equivalent standard
* Establish and utilize a policy and process for how cryptographic keys will be managed
* Ensure that any secret key is protected from unauthorized access
* Store keys in a proper secrets vault as described below
* Use independent keys when multiple keys are required
* Build support for changing algorithms and keys when needed
* Build application features to handle a key rotation

#### File management

* Do not pass user supplied data directly to any dynamic include function
* Require authentication before allowing a file to be uploaded
* Limit the type of files that can be uploaded to only those types that are needed for business purposes
* Validate uploaded files are the expected type by checking file headers rather than by file extension
* Do not save files in the same web context as the application
* Prevent or restrict the uploading of any file that may be interpreted by the web server.
* Turn off execution privileges on file upload directories
* When referencing existing files, use an allow-list of allowed file names and types
* Do not pass user supplied data into a dynamic redirect
* Do not pass directory or file paths, use index values mapped to pre-defined list of paths
* Never send the absolute file path to the client
* Ensure application files and resources are read-only
* Scan user uploaded files for viruses and malware
