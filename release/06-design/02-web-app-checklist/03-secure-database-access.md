### 4.2.3 Checklist: Secure Database Access

Ensure that access to all data stores is secure, including both relational databases and NoSQL databases.

Refer to proactive control [C3: Secure Database Access][control3]
for more context from the OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls project,
and use the list below as suggestions for a checklist that has been tailored for the individual project.

#### Secure queries

* Use Query Parameterization to prevent untrusted input being interpreted as part of a SQL command
* Use strongly typed parameterized queries
* Utilize input validation and output encoding and be sure to address meta characters
* Do not run the database command if input validation fails
* Ensure that variables are strongly typed
* Connection strings should not be hard coded within the application
* Connection strings should be stored in a separate configuration file on a trusted system and they should be encrypted

#### Secure configuration

* The application should use the lowest possible level of privilege when accessing the database
* Use stored procedures to abstract data access and allow for the removal of permissions to the base tables in the database
* Close the database connection as soon as possible
* Turn off all unnecessary database functionality
* Remove unnecessary default vendor content, for example sample schemas
* Disable any default accounts that are not required to support business requirements

#### Secure authentication

* Remove or change all default database administrative passwords
* The application should connect to the database with different credentials for every trust distinction
    (for example user, read-only user, guest, administrators)
* Use secure credentials for database access
