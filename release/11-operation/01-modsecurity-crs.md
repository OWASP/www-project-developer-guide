### 9.1 ModSecurity Core Rule Set

The OWASP ModSecurity [Core Rule Set][modcrs-project] (CRS) project is a set of generic attack detection rules
for use with [ModSecurity][modsecurity] compatible web application firewalls such as [OWASP Coraza][coraza].
CRS is an OWASP Flagship tool project and can be [downloaded][modcrs-download] for either Apache or IIS/Nginx web servers.

#### What is the Core Rule Set?

The [Core Rule Set][modcrs] (CRS) are attack detection rules for use with [ModSecurity][modsecurity],
[Coraza[coraza] and other ModSecurity compatible web application firewalls.
The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks with a minimum of false alerts.
The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories, including those in the OWASP Top Ten.

#### Why use it?

If an organization is using a Coraza, ModSecurity or compatible Web Application Firewall (WAF)
then it is very likely that the [Core Rule Set][modcrs] is already in use by this WAF.
The CRS provides the policy for the Coraza / Modsecurity engine so that traffic to a web application is inspected
for various attacks and malicious traffic is blocked.

#### How to use it

The use of the Core Rule Set assumes that a ModSecurity, Coraza or compatible WAF has been installed.
Refer to the [Coraza tutorial][coraza-tutorial] or the [ModSecurity][modsecdocs] on how to do this.

To get started with CRS refer to the Core Rule Set [installation instructions][modcrs-download].

The OWASP Spotlight series provides an overview of how to use this Core Rule Set:
'Project 3 - [Core Rule Set (CRS) - 1st Line of Defense][spotlight03]'.
