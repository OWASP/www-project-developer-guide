## 10. Metrics

Metrics are important in an organization for various reasons, and in software security they can be used to:

* measure the effectiveness of security controls
* determine security posture
* provide justification for security programs
* and others

At present the OWASP [Integration Standards project Application Wayfinder][wayfinder] project
does not identify any OWASP projects that gather or process metrics, but this may change in the future.
