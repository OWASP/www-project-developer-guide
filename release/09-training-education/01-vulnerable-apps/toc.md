### 7.1 Vulnerable Applications

Vulnerable applications are useful for the Training and Education activities
described in the SAMM [Training and Awareness][sammgegta] section,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

The vulnerable applications provide a safe environment where various vulnerable targets can be attacked.
This provides practice in using various penetration tools available to a tester,
without the risk of attack traffic triggering intrusion detection systems.
