## 2. Foundations

There are various foundational concepts and terminology that are commonly used in software security.
Although some of these concepts are based on heavy-duty theory and can be complex to implement,
the principles are often fairly straight forward and are accessible for every software engineer.
A reasonable grasp of these foundational concepts allows development teams to understand and implement
software security for the application or system under development.
