### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the OWASP Development Guide.

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project ([OWASP][about]) is a nonprofit foundation
that works to improve the security of software.
It is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted.

Along with the OWASP Top Ten, the Developer Guide is one of the original resources
published soon after the OWASP foundation was formed in 2001.
Version 1.0 of the Developer Guide was released in 2002
and since then there have been various [releases][versions] culminating in version 2.0 in 2005.
Since then the guide has been revised extensively to bring it up to date and no longer has version numbers;
notionally it is version 4.x as version 3.0 was never released.

The purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to security concepts
and a handy reference for application / system developers.
Generally it describes security practices using the advice given in the
OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model ([SAMM][samm]) and describes the OWASP projects
referenced in the OWASP [Application Wayfinder][wayfinder] project.

The content of the Developer Guide is aimed at an introductory level, with more detail provided by each OWASP project.
This guide does not seek to replicate the many excellent sources on specific security topics;
it will rarely deal with a subject in depth and instead provides links for greater depth in these security topics.

All of the OWASP projects and tools described in this guide are free to download and use.
All OWASP projects are open source, so if you are interested in improving application security then do get involved.

#### Audience

The OWASP Developer Guide has been written by the security community to help software developers write solid,
safe and secure applications.
Application developers should try to be familiar with the entire guide;
it is far harder to write solid applications than to destroy them.

You can regard the purpose of this guide as answering the question:
 “I am a developer and I need a reference guide to describe the security activities I really should be doing
 and to navigate the numerous security tools and projects”

Or you can regard this guide as a companion document to the OWASP [Application Wayfinder][wayfinder] project:
the Wayfinder maps out the many OWASP tools, projects and documents with the Developer Guide providing some context.
