### 8.2 Security Champions

A 'Security Champion' is a member of a software development team who is
the liaison between Information Security and developers.
This helps to embed security into the development organization.

Security Champions and the necessary supporting program are described in
the SAMM [Organization and Culture][sammgegtb] section,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

Depending on the development team the Security Champion may be a software developer, tester, product manager
or any role within the team; what matters most is an enthusiasm for software security and a willingness to learn.
Security Champions can assist with researching, verifying,
and prioritizing security and compliance related software defects within the application/product.

Security Champions will usually be involved in risk/threat assessments and architectural reviews
and can often help identify opportunities to remediate security defects;
making the architecture of the application more resilient and reducing the attack threat surface.
Security Champions also participate in periodic briefings to increase awareness
and expertise in different security disciplines.

The two goals of the Security Champion program are to increase effectiveness of application security and compliance
and to strengthen the relationship between development teams and Information Security teams.
The program should supply Security Champions with additional training
to help develop their role as a software security subject matter expert.
If possible the Security Champion should be provided with time for Information Security related activities,
and this may well have to be negotiated with the development management hierarchy.

Importantly it should be recognized that Security Champions are often taking on an extra role
in addition to their existing one, and it is important that support is provided by the program for their well-being.
