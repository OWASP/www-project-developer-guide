## 2. Foundations

There are various foundational concepts and terminology that are commonly used in software security.
Although many of these concepts are complex to implement and are based on heavy-duty theory,
the principles are often fairly straight forward and are accessible for every software engineer.

A reasonable grasp of these foundational concepts allows development teams to understand and implement
software security for the application or system under development.
This Developer Guide can only give a brief overview of these concepts,
for in-depth knowledge refer to the many texts on security such as the [The Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge][cbok].

Sections:

2.1 [Security fundamentals](01-security-fundamentals.md)  
2.2 [Secure development and integration](02-secure-development.md)  
2.3 [Principles of security](03-security-principles.md)  
2.4 [Principles of cryptography](04-crypto-principles.md)  
2.5 [OWASP Top 10](05-top-ten.md)
