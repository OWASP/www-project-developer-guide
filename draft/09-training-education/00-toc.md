## 7. Training and Education

Training and Education activities are described by in the SAMM [Training and Awareness][sammgegta] section,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

The goal of security training and education is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks
along with security best practices and secure software design principles.
The security awareness training should be customised for all roles currently involved in the management,
development, testing, or auditing of the applications and systems.
In addition a Learning Management System or equivalent should be in place to track
the employee training and certification processes.

OWASP provides various resources and environments that can help with this security training and education.
