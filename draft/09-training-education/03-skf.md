### 7.3 SKF education

The [Security Knowledge Framework][skf] (SKF) is an expert system application that uses various open source projects
to support development teams and security architects in building secure applications.
The Security Knowledge Framework uses the OWASP [Application Security Verification Standard][asvs] (ASVS) with code examples
to help developers in pre-development and post-development phases and create applications that are secure by design.

Having been an OWASP flagship project for many years the SKF is now no longer within the OWASP organization;
it will continue to be referenced in the OWASP Wayfinder and other OWASP projects
because it is certainly a flagship project for any organization.

#### What is the Security Knowledge Framework?

The [SKF][skf] is a web application that is available from the [github repo][skfinstall].
There is [a demo version][skfdemo] of SKF that is useful for exploring the multiple benefits of the SKF.
Note that SKF is in a process of migrating to a [new repository][skfrepo] so the download link may change.

The SKF provides training and guidance for application security:

* Requirements [organizer][skfreqs]
* Learning [courses][skfdemo]
* Practice [labs][skflabs]
* Documentation on [installing and using][skfdocs] the SKF

#### Why use the SKF?

The SKF provides both [learning courses][skfdemo] and [practice labs][skflabs]
that are useful for development teams to practice secure coding skills.

The following learning courses are available (as of December 2023):

* Developing Secure Software (LFD121)
* Understanding the OWASP Top 10 Security Threats (SKF100)
* Secure Software Development: Implementation (LFD105x)

and there are plans for more training courses.
All of these courses (LFD121, SKF100 and LFD105x) are provided by the [Linux Foundation][linuxtraining].

In addition to the training courses there are a wide range of practice labs (64 as of December 2023).

#### How to use the SKF

The easiest way to get started with the SKF training is to [try the online demo][skfdemo].
This will provide access to the practice labs, the training courses and also to the requirements tool.
