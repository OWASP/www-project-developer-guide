### 8.4 Mobile Application Security

The OWASP [Mobile Application Security][mas] (MAS) flagship project has the mission statement:
"Define the industry standard for mobile application security".

OWASP [MAS Crackmes][mascrack], also known as UnCrackable Apps,
is a collection of reverse engineering challenges for the MAS project.

The MAS project covers the processes, techniques, and tools used for security testing a mobile application,
as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.
The OWASP MAS project provides the [Mobile Application Security Verification Standard][masvs] (MASVS)
for mobile applications and a comprehensive [Mobile Application Security Testing Guide][mastg] (MASTG).

#### What is MAS Crackmes?

OWASP [MAS Crackmes][mascrack] is a set of reverse engineering challenges for mobile applications.
These challenges are used as examples throughout the OWASP [Mobile Application Security Testing Guide][mastg] (MASTG)
and, of course, you can also solve them for fun.

There are challenges for [Android][masandroid] and a couple for [Apple iOS][masios].

#### Why use MAS Crackmes?

Working through the challenges will improve understanding of mobile application security,
and will also give an insight into the examples provided in the MASTG.

#### How to try the challenges

1. Select and download a challenge into your mobile application environment
2. Satisfy the individual challenge exercise
3. Have fun

Each challenge has various solutions provided by the community; these can be used to compare with your solution.
