## 6.5 Verification Do's and Don'ts

[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm].

Verification takes skill and knowledge, so it is important to build on the existing experience
contained in these Do's and Dont's.

Sections:

6.5.1 [Secure environment](#secure-environment)  
6.5.2 [System hardening](#system-hardening)  
6.5.3 [Open Source software](#open-source-software)
