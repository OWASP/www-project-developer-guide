## 3. Requirements

Security requirements also provide a foundation of vetted security functionality for an application.
Instead of creating a custom approach to security for every application,
standard security requirements allow developers to reuse the definition of security controls and best practices;
those same vetted security requirements provide solutions for security issues that have occurred in the past.

The importance of understanding key security requirements is described in the [Security Requirements][sammdsr]
practice that is part of the [Design][sammd] business function section within the OWASP [SAMM model][samm].
Ideally structured software security requirements are available within with a security a requirements framework,
and these are utilized by both developer teams and product teams.
In addition suppliers to the organization must meet security requirements;
build security into supplier agreements in order to ensure compliance with organizational security requirements.

In summary, security requirements exist to prevent the repeat of past security failures.
