## OWASP Foundation Developer Guide project

This repo is the source for the OWASP Developer Guide project [web pages][pages]
and also the [developer guide][dgrelease] itself.

## Developer Guide

This guide is one of the original documents from OWASP and so has a long history.
The [original DevGuide repository][devguide] has many of the [previous versions][versions]
going back to the [original version 1.0][original] from 2002.
Note that the original DevGuide repository has been deprecated in favor of this one.

The source for the latest draft developer guide can be found under the ['draft'][draft] directory.
The source is in markdown and is used to create the developer guide HTML, PDF and ePub outputs.
The draft content is subject to large scale changes with no notice.

Note that the draft version provides the content for the released version of Developer Guide,
in the ['release'][release] directory, promoted during the automated release process.
Therefore any manual changes under the release directory are likely to be over-written.

### Contributing

Contributions and suggestions for the Developer Guide are all welcome;
make a start by reading the [contributing guidelines][guide] and follow the [contributing code of conduct][conduct].

For other contributions to these pages please [create an issue][issues] or open a [pull request][request].

The easiest way to get in contact with the development community for this documentation project
is via the OWASP Slack [#project-developer-guide][project] project channel
(you may need to [subscribe](https://owasp.org/slack/invite) first).
