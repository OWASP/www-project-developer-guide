## Contributing to the Developer Guide

The OWASP Developer Guide is first and foremost a guide for development teams,
and is intended to be a body of knowledge that these teams can draw on and should be familiar with.
The Developer Guide is a community effort with a diverse and wide range of contributors
from across the whole software security field.
The Developer Guide does not seek to replicate the various projects and resources already available,
such as OWASP ASVS or WSTG, but provides basic and medium level introductions to software security;
referencing other projects for a more in depth or advanced treatment of the subjects.

There are various areas of the guide that need content; please contribute where you can.
If you feel a section is missing then suggest changes to the structure in a [feature request][feature].

Be sure to follow our [code of conduct][conduct] and the [contributing guidelines][contribute]
which provide style and document structure suggestions.
