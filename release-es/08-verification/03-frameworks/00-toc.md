### 6.3 Verification frameworks

[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm]
and both [Security Testing][sammvst] and [Requirements-driven Testing][sammvrt] are an important part of verification.

Verification testing can benefit from using frameworks to support continuous and automated security testing.
Use of a framework can provide:

* automation of a security analysis pipeline
* flexibility to run a series of tools in a pipeline
* scalability for multiple security scanners
* control interfaces
