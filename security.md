## Security Policy

This project is built on markdown which is used to create binary files,
such as `.pdf` and `.epub,` and the site itself.
It is not impossible that a malicious actor could somehow embed malware
in the markdown or subvert the document creation process.
If you find anything suspicious in either the markdown or pipeline scripts
then let us know ASAP and we will fix it as a priority.

Open a [security advisory][advisory] and this will be provided
only to the project's admins and in strict confidence.
